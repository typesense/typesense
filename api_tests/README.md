# Typesense API Tests

A fully‚Äëfeatured api test harness that spins up Typesense in both single‚Äë and multi‚Äënode modes, executes phase‚Äëscoped test suites, and tears everything down again.¬†Each logical phase of testing (fresh start, restart, snapshot¬†restore, etc.) is completely isolated and reproducible.

## Phase Matrix

| Path | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Single-node** | `SINGLE_FRESH` | A brand-new Typesense server is started. |
| | `SINGLE_RESTARTED` | Same server is stopped and started again using the *same* data directory. |
| | `SINGLE_SNAPSHOT` | A snapshot is taken, the server is restarted, and the snapshot is restored. |
| **Multi-node (3-node RAFT)** | `MULTI_FRESH` | A fresh 3-node cluster is started. |
| | `MULTI_RESTARTED` | Every node is gracefully stopped and restarted. |
| | `MULTI_SNAPSHOT` | A snapshot is taken on the leader, the cluster is restarted, and the snapshot is restored on all nodes. |

The phases within a given path run **sequentially** because each later phase re‚Äëuses the data produced by the previous one. The single‚Äënode and multi‚Äënode paths run **in parallel** to reduce build time.

> [!NOTE]
> Single-node server is always run on 8108 when running api_tests

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-node server is always run on 5108, 6108, 7108 when running api_tests

## Writing a New Test Suite

Create a `*.test.ts` file under `api_tests/tests/` and declare only the `describe` blocks you need. For instance, if your feature must persist across a single‚Äënode restart but does not require snapshots or clustering, you might only target `SINGLE_FRESH` + `SINGLE_RESTARTED`.

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "bun:test";
import { Phases } from "../src/constants";
import { fetchSingleNode } from "../src/request";

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Seed data in the fresh phase
describe(Phases.SINGLE_FRESH, () => {
  it("create collection", async () => {
    const res = await fetchSingleNode("/collections", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: "companies",
        fields: [{ name: "company_name", type: "string" }],
      }),
    });
    expect(res.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});

// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assert persistence after restart
describe(Phases.SINGLE_RESTARTED, () => {
  it("collection should persist", async () => {
    const res = await fetchSingleNode("/collections/companies");
    expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  });
```

An template file containing all the phases,  
```ts
describe(Phases.SINGLE_FRESH, () => {
  it("test 1", async () => {
   ...
  });

  it("test 2", async () => {
   ...
  });
});

describe(Phases.SINGLE_RESTARTED, () => {
  it("test 1", async () => {
   ...
  });

  it("test 2", async () => {
   ...
  });
});

describe(Phases.SINGLE_SNAPSHOT, () => {
  it("test 1", async () => {
   ...
  });

  it("test 2", async () => {
   ...
  });
});

describe(Phases.MULTI_FRESH, () => {
  it("test 1", async () => {
   ...
  });

  it("test 2", async () => {
   ...
  });
});

describe(Phases.MULTI_RESTARTED, () => {
  it("test 1", async () => {
   ...
  });

  it("test 2", async () => {
   ...
  });
});

describe(Phases.MULTI_SNAPSHOT, () => {
  it("test 1", async () => {
   ...
  });

  it("test 2", async () => {
   ...
  });
});

```
Also, you can use a describe with `NO_PHASE` when you can entirely manage the lifecyle of the typesense-server using `TypesenseProcessManager`
```ts
describe(Phases.NO_PHASE, () => {
  it("test 1", async () => {
   ...
  });

  it("test 2", async () => {
   ...
  });
});
```

Please refer to `collections.test.ts` and `health.test.ts` for reference tests. These examples are the quickest way to copy‚Äëpaste a skeleton for new features.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data dependencies between phases

All *cluster‚Äëlevel* operations (snapshot creation, server restart, cluster restart) are performed **between** phases by `TypesenseProcessManager`.  That means **any state you need in a later phase must be created in an earlier one** under the same path:

* Want to verify a collection still exists after `SINGLE_RESTARTED`? Create it during `SINGLE_FRESH`.
* Need documents to appear in search results after `MULTI_SNAPSHOT`? Index them during `MULTI_FRESH` or `MULTI_RESTARTED`.

Phases are therefore best thought of as a *progressive timeline* rather than independent test shards.
## Request Helpers

### `fetchSingleNode(path: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<Response>`

* Targets `http://localhost:8108`.
* Automatically injects the header `X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: xyz`.
* Use it for all **single-node** phases.

```ts
const res = await fetchSingleNode("/health");
```

### `fetchMultiNode(node: 1 | 2 | 3, path: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<Response>`

* Maps node ‚Üí port as **1 ‚áí 5108**, **2 ‚áí 6108**, **3 ‚áí 7108**.
* Polls the RAFT *commit-index* across all three nodes until they match, guaranteeing cluster‚Äëwide consistency before your request runs.
* Same API‚Äëkey injection as above.

```ts
// Query the leader (node 1)
await fetchMultiNode(1, "/collections/companies");
```

Happy testing! üéâ
